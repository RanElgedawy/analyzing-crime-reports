He was armed with a handgun and wore a bulletproof vest. He reportedly ordered the women to lie down on the floor and shot them execution-style. After a standoff with police, he surrendered and was taken into custody. A week prior, Xaver had quit a job as a prison guard trainee, and authorities said they believed the shooting was \"a random act\" and that roberry did not appear to be a motive. An ex-girlfriend in Indiana told local media she'd been “scared for years” by Xaver’s talk of violence and death, but that her warnings to others (who she did not identify) were not taken seriously. She said she’d first met Xaver in a psychiatric hospital in 2013. In March 2017, Michigan State Police documented an incident in which Xaver indicated he was “possibly thinking of suicide by cop and taking hostages.\"\n",

He reportedly ordered the women to lie down on the floor and shot them execution-style. After a standoff with police, he surrendered and was taken into custody. A week prior, Xaver had quit a job as a prison guard trainee, and authorities said they believed the shooting was \"a random act\" and that roberry did not appear to be a motive. An ex-girlfriend in Indiana told local media she'd been “scared for years” by Xaver’s talk of violence and death, but that her warnings to others (who she did not identify) were not taken seriously. She said she’d first met Xaver in a psychiatric hospital in 2013. In March 2017, Michigan State Police documented an incident in which Xaver indicated he was “possibly thinking of suicide by cop and taking hostages.\"</td>\n",
